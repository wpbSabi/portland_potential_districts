# Portland - Potential city council districts modeled with 2020 census tract data 

Background:
* There is a city charter on the ballot for Portland, Oregon on November 8, 2022.  As part of this city charter update, Portland would establish four city council districts.  Read more about that change from [Portland United for Change](https://portlandunitedforchange.com/about).
* This GitHub repository uses 2020 census tract data to illustrate what four potential city council districts could look like based on relativelu equal population representation from each district.  There will be at least five options shown below.

Portland population distribution:
* While it would be easy to draw the potentital new district lines along Portland's five "quadrants" (not including South), the distribution of population in Portland is not equal among these quadrants.
* The largest quadrant by population is Southeast, whereas the smallest quadrant by population is North.

Conclusion (Draft):
* There have been several approaches shared for mapping equal-population districts for Portland in the case that the city charter is updated to have districts.  However, each district has pros and cons; there is not a perfect map.
* Fortunately, the city charter update would take into account that there are no perfect maps.  Each district would have three representatives and each of them would be elected by ranked-choice voting in the same election.  
* That way, communities within each district can have their representative of choice elected, as long as that candidate is one of the top three vote earners in the election. See [Portland United for Change](https://portlandunitedforchange.com/about) for more details.
